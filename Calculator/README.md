Description project: The program is a web application in the form of a calculator with simple functionality. Visualization is implemented through the use of **JSP** and **CSS**. To handle user interaction with the calculator, a local server and a **servlet** are used for calculation. To make this possible, the software was deployed to a local server – [Tomcat v9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Tomcat) is an open source servlet container. Also, the logging framework – [Apache Log4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j) was used. In addition, a [GET-request](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#GET) class was implemented in the project, and corresponding tests were written for this class.
